Improve your speed score on GTmetrix, Pingdom Tools and Google PageSpeed Insights by merging and minifying CSS and JavaScript, compressing HTML and a few more speed optimization options. 
 

== Description ==
Speed optimization plugin for developers and advanced users. This plugin reduces HTTP requests by merging CSS & JavaScript files. It minifies CSS and JS files with PHP Minify, the same library used on most cache plugins.

Minification is done on the frontend during the first uncached request. Once the first request is processed, any other pages that require the same set of CSS and JavaScript files, will reuse the same generated file.

The plugin includes options for developers and advanced users, however the default settings should work just fine for most sites.
Kindly read the HELP section after installing the plugin, about possible issues and how to solve them.

= Aditional Optimization =

I can offer you aditional `custom made` optimization on top of this plugin. If you would like to hire me, please visit my profile links for further information.


= Features =

*	Merge JS and CSS files into groups to reduce the number of HTTP requests
*	Google Fonts merging, inlining and optimization
*	Handles scripts loaded both in the header & footer separately
*	Keeps the order of the scripts even if you exclude some files from minification
*	Supports localized scripts (https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_localize_script)
*	Minifies CSS and JS with PHP Minify only, no third party software or libraries needed.
*	Option to defer JavaScript and CSS files, either globally or pagespeed insights only.
*	Creates static cache files in the uploads directory.
*	Preserves your original files, by duplicating and copying those files to the uploads directory 
*	View the status and detailed logs on the WordPress admin page.
*	Option to Minify HTML, remove extra info from the header and other optimizations.
*	Ability to turn off minification for JS, CSS or HTML (purge the cache to see it)
*	Ability to turn off CSS or JS merging completely (so you can debug which section causes conflicts and exclude the offending files)
*	Ability to manually ignore JavaScript or CSS files that conflict when merged together (please report if you find some)
*	Support for conditional scripts and styles, as well as inlined code that depends on the handles
*	Support for multisite installations (each site has its own settings)

*	and some more...


= WP-CLI Commands =
*	Purge all caches: `wp fvm purge`

*	Purge all caches on the entire network (linux): `wp site list --field=url | xargs -n1 -I % wp --url=% fvm purge`
*	Get cache size: `wp fvm stats`
*	Get cache size on a network site: `wp --url=blog.example.com fvm stats`
*	Get cache size on each site (linux): `wp site list --field=url | xargs -n1 -I % wp --url=% fvm stats`


= Notes =
